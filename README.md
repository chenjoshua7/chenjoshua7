# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Josh!

Hi! I'm Josh, a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. My other areas of interest include Statistical Inference, Recommendation Systems, and Natural Language Processing. Beyond ML, I enjoy: my_python_expertise.extend(new_projects) and playing around with math problems. Check out more about me and my projects at https://chenjoshua7.github.io.

I found my love of data from studying Mathematics + Economics at Boston College. As I begin my final term at Barcelona School of Economics, I'm taking a Reinforcement Learning course, interning with the World Bank, and writing my Master's Thesis on CNNs versus Vision Transformers. This challenging yet rewarding chapter of my life is nearing its end, and I'm excited to return to the States to start my career in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently seeking full-time jobs in Data Science/ML, hit me up!
